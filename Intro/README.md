# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to help edit my html, Javascript, and css files. I also used VSC to display my code on a live server.

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create my page. HTML was used to create the main content for the website. CSS was used to edit the appearance of the website. Finally Javascript was used to add functionality to the website and allow for users to submit their name.
